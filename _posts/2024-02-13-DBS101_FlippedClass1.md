# Lesson learned from flipped class

Greetings everyone! Todays journal is about lessons I have learned from the flipped class I have attended. In our recent flipped class session, we explored the fundamentals concepts of DBA's and its different types of people who use databases. 

First things first, DBA's are like superheroes of data as they make sure everything about our information are safe and runs smoothly within the data system.Next thing that I came to know about is their roles and responsibilities. They design and take care of databases, making sure it is safe from bad stuff and plans for emergencies. 

Now,lets talk about the people who use databases. From what we have discussed in the class, I came to know about 7 different types of database users. This includes Naive/Parametric End Users, System Analyst, Sophisticated Users, Database Designers, Application Programmers, Casual Users/ Temporary Users and Specialized Users with each having specific way of using database and knowledge on it.

To conclude, my journey into Database Administration has been pretty fun. I have learned that DBA's have important roles and responsibilities, taking care of our data and helping all kinds of users who uses database. I am excited to learn more about how DBA's work and I also admired the work of DBA's and wants to be one of them.

# What I did in flipped class

Today's learning was different! Our tutor Miss Palden Ongmo Lhendup introduced a cool way of learning called flipped class. But befofre flipped class we were told to learn something from notes provided by Miss in google chat via links which was efficient for self learning. 

During the class, we got into small groups which was grouped by our module tutor to discuss about what we learned. Talking and discussing with my mates helped me get it even better.After group discussion we got mixed into new groups. Now, me along with my mates had to share what we have discussed in the previous group to the new mixed group. After we were done with the mixed group discussion Our tutor picked someone from each group to ask question based on the topic we were supposed to discuss to check whether we have discussed well and learned something.

This way of learning changed how we usually do things when it comes to learning. Me along with my friends didn't just sit and listen but we used used websites for notes for self learning and talked or discussed with friends on the particular topic for better understanding which was pretty fun and helpful.

# How can flipped class be improved

Overall the flipped class for me was interesting and fun but there are some sides were it can be improved like providing more notes on the given topic and monitoring the work of or the progress of the work should be done strictly for efficient learning progress.
