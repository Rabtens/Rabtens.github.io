### Topic : NUll values and Set operations in SQL.

# Lesson learned from flipped class

Greetings everyone! Todays journal is about lessons I have learned from the flipped class I have attended. In our recent flipped class session, we explored the fundamentals concepts null values and set operations in SQL.

In SQL, null values act like placeholders for missing or undefined information in a database. They are like empty slots waiting to be filled. They represent the unknown or missing data in a particular column of a table.For example, if you have a table of employees and some of them haven't specified their birthdates, the birthdate column for those employees would have null values.Handling null values in SQL is important because they can impact the accuracy of the queries and the calculations. It's like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces â€“ you need to be aware of these gaps to get a clear information about the data. And the most common method of handling missing value is using the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL conditions in WHERE clauses to filter out or include rows with null values.

Now, let's talk about set operations in SQL, which involve manipulating and combining sets of data. There are 4 types of set operations, which includes Union, UnionAll, Interscet and Minus. Going on with each of the types; Union combines two sets, removing duplicates to create a single, unified set and then Union All combines two sets, including all duplicate elements, creating a merged set with every occurrence from both sets, Intersection finds common elements between two sets showing only the overlapping parts and lastly Difference (or Minus) which identifies unique elements in the first set that are not present in the second set.

In conclusion, navigating null values and set operations in SQL is like solving a puzzle and playing with building blocks. With these tools, you can confidently manage missing information and manipulate datasets to extract meaningful results from your databases.

# What I did in flipped class

As usual our tutor devided us into Home group where each group was given a topic to discuss. Then after giving the topic miss gave us plenty of time to discuss on the topic were we discussed and shared each other's knowledge in the Home group which led us to knowing a lot about the topic. The topic I got was Null values in SQL which I gained a lot of information on the topic through the discussion. After the discussion, we were again divided in to groups called Expert group.

In the group we dicussed the points on different topics. I shared my points on what null values are in sql and its working while other members shared their points on the particular topic they were assigned to discuss. After a long discussion we were satisfied with our learning and then was ready for miss to continue the class. After the provided time was over miss ended the class with giving some information about what we will learn in next class.

# How can flipped class be improved
Overall the flipped class for me was interesting and fun but there are some sides were it can be improved like providing more notes on the given topic and monitoring the work of or the progress of the work should be done strictly for efficient learning progress.
