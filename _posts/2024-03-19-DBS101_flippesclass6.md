### Topic : Advantages, Disadvantages and Applications of types of Nonrelational Databases.

### Lesson learned from flipped class.

In today's world where we use a lot of data, we need ways to store it efficiently and in a way that can grow as our needs grow. That's where non-relational databases, also called NoSQL databases, come in. Unlike the traditional relational databases that organize data into neat little tables, these newer databases are more flexible. They can handle all sorts of different types of data and can handle a lot of it at once. Let's talk about why these databases are great, what  some of the downsides are, and where we use them along with its definition and types based on my understanding.

### What is NO Sql?

NoSQL Database is a non-relational Data Management System, that does not require a fixed schema. It avoids joins, and is easy to scale. The major purpose of using a NoSQL database is for distributed data stores with humongous data storage needs. NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example, companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google collect terabytes of user data every single day.

### Type of No SQL Database.

NoSQL Databases are mainly categorized into six types: Key-value pair, Column-oriented, Graph-based, Time series, Vector-based and Document-oriented. Every category has its unique attributes and limitations. None of the above-specified database is better to solve all the problems. Users should select the database based on their product needs.

### 1. Key Valued Pair Based.

Data is stored in key/value pairs. It is designed in such a way to handle lots of data and heavy load. Key-value pair storage databases store data as a hash table where each key is unique, and the value can be a JSON, BLOB(Binary Large Objects), string, etc.

For example, a key-value pair may contain a key like “Name” associated with a value like “Dorji”.


It is one of the most basic NoSQL database example. This kind of NoSQL database is used as a collection, dictionaries, associative arrays, etc. Key value stores help the developer to store schema-less data. 

### Applications.

1. Quick Data Storage: Imagine having a bunch of keys (like in a real-life keychain) and each key is connected to a small piece of information. That's how key-value pair databases work. They store data in a simple way: we have a key and its corresponding value. This makes it really easy to store and find information quickly.

2. Online Shopping Carts: When we add items to our online shopping cart, key-value pair databases can keep track of what we have selected. Each item is linked to our unique ID, so when we come back later, our cart is still filled with the items we picked out.

3. Managing Website Sessions: Websites keep us logged in even when we navigate to different pages? Key-value pair databases help with that too. They store our session ID along with our user information, so the website can recognize us and keep us logged in as we browse around.

### 2. Column Based

Column-oriented databases work on columns. Every column is treated separately. Values of single column databases are stored contiguously.

































### What I did in flipped class.

Before our flipped class session started, our tutor briefly taught us about the topics of normal forms, and notes were provided via Google Chat for reference during the flipped class. Then, we were divided into 6 groups, each with a different topic on types of normal forms. In our groups, we discussed the assigned topic for around 30 minutes. After the allotted time, we were reorganized into different groups, with each member assigned a different topic to share their knowledge. Following the discussions, our tutor asked questions to members to assess their understanding of the concepts discussed in the second group. After several question-and-answer sessions, our class concluded.
