### Topic : ER Diagram Representation

# Lesson learned from flipped class

Kuzuzangpo La! Yet another exciting session of flipped class on Entity-Relationship(ER) models and its basic concepts. After learning about "What Database users and Database Administrator?" are, learning about Database has never been this exciting! The session started with a basic concepts of ER models, serving as a roadmap for understanding how entities, attributes, and relationships come together to create a structured framework for databases.

First thing that I learned from the class was how crucial or important it is to accurately identify and define the entities.(The starting point for a strong and oraganized data). After that I came to know that Attributes or the characteistics that describes entities, are like the details that brings Lego pieces together. Then I learned about different types of attributes which includes simple,composite, derived, single and multi- valued atrributes each with different meanings adding richness to the information we can capture in an ER model. Next up were relationships, the connections between entities. They act like the glue that stick things together. Then I came to know how entities can relate to each other and the different types of relationships which is known as cardinalities.

In conclusion, today's class was like a journey where I discovered the basics of ER models. What I found most interesting was how interactive and engaging the learning experience was. Instead of just listening, I found myself actively involved, pausing to think and discussing with classmates to make sure I understood everything clearing my doubts and sharing my thoughts to them. Now knowing what ER models are and its basic concepts, I am eager to use these concepts in real-world situations.

# What I did in flipped class
Today's class was super interesting! Our class got split into groups, and each group got a cool task to make an ER diagram on a topic our tutor gave us. We got chart paper and marker pens and started working together to turn all those big ideas into a picture.

We only had one hour, so it was like a race! Testing what we understood and how well we could work together. We had to make sure our diagrams really showed what the topic was all about, not just drawing lines and shapes. It was turning our new knowledge into something real. When each group presented their diagram in a quick 5-minute presentation, it was so cool to see all the different ideas and creativity. Our tutor, Miss Palden Ongmo Lhendup then asked us questions, making us think even more about the ER models. This part was super interactive and made the class feel like a team effort. Miss then helped us clear any doubts we had and made sure we understood everything well. The class finished with a crucial step fixing mistakes in our ER diagrams. 

At the end, Miss collected all our corrected charts. It was like a record of what we all did together. Seeing how our understanding changed from theory to actually doing things on paper was really cool. Working together not only helped us understand ER models better but also showed how important teamwork and talking to each other are in designing databases. I am excited for more upcoming flipped class which will soon come as learning by interacting with friends is more fun rather then only listening.

# How can flipped class be improved

Today's class was more of fun and also I learned alot compared to previous flipped class so, from my opinion no further changes is needed if the flipped class is going to have same amount of effort from ourside as well as our tutor like in previous session.
